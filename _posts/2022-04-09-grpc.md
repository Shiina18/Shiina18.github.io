只涉及很基础的 general idea. gRPC is an RPC implementation using Protocol Buffers by Google.

## Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

一种基于 client-server 模型的范式, 另外还有 Representational State Transfer (REST).

> In distributed computing, a **remote procedure call (RPC)** is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. 
> 
> RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces.
>
> To let different clients access servers, a number of standardized RPC systems have been created. Most of these use an interface description language (IDL) to let various platforms call the RPC.

## gRPC

![](https://shiina18.github.io/assets/posts/images/90133315226743.png)

By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, Google's mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data (like JSON). 

The first step when working with protocol buffers is to define the structure for the data you want to serialize in a **proto file**: this is an ordinary text file with a `.proto` extension. Protocol buffer data is structured as **messages**, where each message is a small logical record of information containing a series of name-value pairs called *fields*. Here’s a simple example:

```proto
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;
  bool has_ponycopter = 3;
}
```

You define gRPC services in ordinary proto files, with RPC method parameters and return types specified as protocol buffer messages. 输入输出都是 `proto` 格式. TensorFlow 用的 `.pb` 也是这个格式.

## Protocol buffers

**只摘录个别要点**

> It's like JSON, except it's smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings. Protocol buffers are the most commonly-used data format at Google.

二进制, 更小, 但 not human readable

劣势

- For data that exceeds a few megabytes, consider a different solution.
- Messages are not compressed.
- Protocol buffer messages are less than maximally efficient in both size and speed for many scientific and engineering uses that involve large, multi-dimensional arrays of floating point numbers.
- Protocol buffers are not a formal standard of any organization.

适合的场景

- **Microservices**: gRPC is designed for low latency and high throughput communication. gRPC is great for lightweight microservices where efficiency is critical.
- **Point-to-point real-time communication**: gRPC has excellent support for bi-directional streaming. gRPC services can push messages in real-time without polling.

为什么叫这个名字? 历史原因, 以前有个类叫 `ProtocolBuffer`, 调用这个类的方法 `AddValue(tag, value)` 存到 buffer, 再一次性写出. 现在这个玩意儿和 buffer 无关了. 参考 [这里](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/faq#why_the_name_protocol_buffers).
