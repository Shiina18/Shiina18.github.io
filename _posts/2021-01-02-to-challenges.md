See [Game Log for Tactics Ogre LUCT One Vision Mod](https://shiina18.github.io/games/2020/07/17/game-log-for-to-ov-mod/) for the old post, and [this repo](https://github.com/Shiina18/tactics_ogre_one_vision_mod_challenges) for the rules and saves I used.

This time I am going to following the refined common rules and [optional rules](https://github.com/Shiina18/tactics_ogre_one_vision_mod_challenges#optional-rules).

## Meta

Recall that Lord, Knight, White Knight, Paladin, Terror Knight, Knight Commander, Angel Knight, Cleric and Priest are banned by Class Clause Plus.

Since I'm still in the middle of path C before new game plus, I don't have legal access to some unique classes, and I won't use them. I also don't have Hydra and Warden.

Additionally, due to Rank Clause, the rank of all skills of ours is fixed rank 4, so we lose some shutdown options via high rank finishers.

### Heal

We might rely on advanced consumables + Lobber for healing (while keep it in mind that the same consumable may only be used 5 times in a battle according to the Heal Clause).

Kirin Blowgun might be the best option for single heal, and we may only have one unit equipping it by the strict version of Weapon Clause (and there is only one may use Lobber).

## Candidate builds

See [here](https://shiina18.github.io/games/2020/07/17/game-log-for-to-ov-mod/#teambuilding) for some of my thoughts about teambuilding.

Remember that this time **we only have 5 skill slots**, so every slot matters.

Format

```
Description for the build

- Equipment (1h weapon + shield by default)
- Skill 1
- Skill 2
- ...
```

### Bahamut (light dragon)

place holder

### Tamer

Monster Supporter and Midfield Attacker

- Sidearm, AVD/DEF+AGI/DEX gears
- Sidearm
- Empower Monster
- 3 from Trajectory / Feral Remedy / Monsterheart / Tactician

Usually, **Spear sidegrade and ranged weapons are the best options for physical classes without magic.** See arguments [here](https://shiina18.github.io/games/2020/07/17/game-log-for-to-ov-mod/#teambuilding).

Ideally, Tamer should tap one skill every turn, and using a ranged weapon allows him to find a better position for both attacking and utilizing a skill in one turn.

```
Tamer extremely needs TP to use class skills every turn
-> high atk
    -> Sidearm. Tamer is tough, so shorter range can be tolerated.
-> high acc
    -> AGI/DEX gears + Trajectory
Tactician helps to reach the TP threshold earlier, and also makes Turn 2 Trajectory possible.
```

**Team Options**

- Classes that can charge TP.
- Classes that can grant Trueflight, e.g. Archer and classes having Ballistics (draconic).
- Classes that can grant Strengthen. Remember that the output of DEX weapons will get more bonuses by the base damage part in calculation.
- Classes that can inflict Leaden.
