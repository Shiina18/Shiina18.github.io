See [Game Log for Tactics Ogre LUCT One Vision Mod](https://shiina18.github.io/games/2020/07/17/game-log-for-to-ov-mod/) for the old post, and [this repo](https://github.com/Shiina18/tactics_ogre_one_vision_mod_challenges) for the rules and saves I used.

This time I am going to following the refined common rules and [optional rules](https://github.com/Shiina18/tactics_ogre_one_vision_mod_challenges#optional-rules).

<!-- more -->

## Meta

Recall that Lord, Knight, White Knight, Paladin, Terror Knight, Knight Commander, Angel Knight, Undead, Cleric and Priest are banned by Class Clause Plus.

Since I'm still in the middle of path C before new game plus, I don't have legal access to some unique classes, and I won't use them. I also don't have Hydra and Warden.

Additionally, due to Rank Clause, the rank of all skills of ours is fixed rank 4, so we lose some shutdown options via high rank finishers.

### Heal

We might rely on advanced consumables + Lobber for healing (while keep it in mind that the same consumable may only be used 5 times in a battle according to the Heal Clause).

Kirin Blowgun might be the best option for single heal, and we may only have one unit equipping it by the strict version of Weapon Clause (and there is only one may use Lobber).

## Candidate builds

See [here](https://shiina18.github.io/games/2020/07/17/game-log-for-to-ov-mod/#teambuilding) for some of my thoughts about teambuilding.

Remember that this time **we only have 5 skill slots**, so every slot matters.

Format

```
Description for the build

- Equipment (1h weapon + shield by default)
- Skill 1
- Skill 2
- ...
```

Usually, **Spear sidegrade and ranged weapons are the best options for physical classes without magic.** See arguments [here](https://shiina18.github.io/games/2020/07/17/game-log-for-to-ov-mod/#teambuilding).

- Attacker: can deal decent damage to most units.
- Wallbreaker: can deal decent damage to tanks (included in Attacker).
- Nuker: can eliminate units using high damage options (with the help of some combo).
- Support: can focus more on using their abilities to gain an advantage for the team. (typically can buff teammates or clean debuffs.)
- Annoyer: can inflict debuffs on enemies.
- Disabler: can inflict shutdown status on units with (nearly) 100% acc.
- Healer
- Tank

### Warrior

**Midline Wallbreaker, Nuker**

- 2H Spear sidegrade, AVD gears
- Spears
- Vigorous Attack
- Mighty Strike
- Double Strike
- Wade / Jump / Squash / Lead Ward / Rampart Aura

As a physical unit using melee weapons without magic, attack range and mobility matter. The 5th skill is decided by the map. Wade and Jump is for mobility. Sqaush removes clones made by Knight.

With a spear sidegrade, Counterhit is not needed. With Double Strike (so Bash is unwanted) and a 2h weapon, he can deal burst damage in one turn.

Considering that the spear provides some AVD, we may maximize AVD to make Warrior highly evasive. 

With an AVD build, Lead Ward will further raise Warrior's survivability and gives him an option to support teammates. As is often the case, Leaden will be inflicted by bow's rank 2 finisher or dark spell Wormhole.

Vigorous Attack may clear Stagger which is deadly to evasive units. With acc buff, AGI gears are not necessary for Warrior. Also, it is essential to tap Vigorous Attack beforehand to make sure Double Strike lands with (nearly) 100% acc. Due to Vigorous Attack, it is not very suitable for Warrior to use ranged weapons since Truestrike and Trueflight overwrite each other.

**Team Options**

- Melee fighters.
- Truestrike. Warrior may have some trouble generating the first 40 or 60 TP without AGI gears.
- Spike Skin. AI is foolish and will attack a unit with Spike Skin. This idea is provided by Vital who watched me use Spike Skin on some unit in a dangerous situation.

**Frontline or Midline Attacker**

- 1H Spear sidegrade, AVD gears or DEF gears
- Spears
- Vigorous Attack
- Mighty Strike
- 2 from Wade / Jump / Squash / Lead Ward / Rampart Aura / Field Alchemy

This build is much more defensive. With an 1h weapon, Warrior cannot deal much damage to tanks and instead focuses on hitting squishy units and supporting melee teammates with Vigorous Attack.

Mirror Aspis (Lv. 24 shield, 40 RES, 20% elem resist) is great to cover the hole of low magic def of Warrior.

**Other Options**

Of course, to make use of Mighty Strike, one might want to equip weapons possessing debuffs on hit. 

### Rogue

**Disabler / Annoyer**

- Blowgun, AVD gears
- Bullseye
- Other 4 skills don't matter and are optional, XX Ward / Sidearms / Tactician / Jump / Heron etc.

Bullseye is god. We need it for a guaranteed disable. 

I don't find it rewarding to use melee builds considering how squishy Rogue is and that he doesn't have magic. Sneak Attack is really useless.

Booby Trap is a very interesting skill if it's used by enemies. However, it requires consumables so are not very attractive under Heal Clause which restircts consumable uses.

Speedstar might be useful for a bow build, but not this one. In a disabler build, it is hard to generate enough TP to make Quick useful, and we need to tap Bullseye every time.

Counterhit shouldn't be equipped if a shutdown blowgun is used. Since by Shutdown Clause, it might lead to an immediate loss.

Non-shutdown blowguns (e.g. fear) are also useful and will be not restricted by Shutdown Clause.

**Team Options**

- Sidearm users (guaranteed Slow, Hobbled with the help of Bullseye).

### Tamer

**Frontline or Midline Ranged Attacker**

- Sidearm, AVD/DEF+AGI/DEX gears
- Sidearm
- Empower Monster
- Feral Remedy
- 2 from Trajectory / Monsterheart / Tactician

Ideally, Tamer should tap one skill every turn, and using a ranged weapon allows him to find a better position for both attacking and utilizing a skill in one turn.

```
Tamer extremely needs TP 
to use class skills every turn
-> high atk
    -> Sidearm. Tamer is tough, 
    so shorter range can be tolerated.
-> high acc
    -> AGI/DEX gears + Trajectory
Tactician helps to reach the TP threshold earlier, 
and also makes Turn 2 Trajectory possible.
```

**Team Options**

- Charge TP.
- Trueflight, e.g. Archer and classes having Ballistics (draconic).
- Strengthen. Remember that the output of DEX weapons will get more bonuses by the base damage part in calculation.
- Leaden.

### Bahamut (light dragon)
