漫画只是针对形式 (容器) 的定义.

> Comics: Juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer.

- Juxtaposed 将漫画区别于电影, 因为电影每个连续的画面都被投射在同一个空间上, 而漫画的每个画面占据不同空间.
- Pictorial images 将文字排除在外, 因为文字也可以视为静态图片 (static images).

漫画画面中的详略处理: 简化人物, 使读者代入, 并突出角色本身传达的信息. 详见开头摘录链接.

## Ch. 7 The six steps

作者的艺术定义非常宽泛

> Art: Any human activity which doesn't grow out of either of our species' 2 basic instincts: survival & reproduction.

1. Idea/purpose: The impluse, the ideas, the emotions, the philosophies, the purposes of the work... The work's "**content**".
2. Form: The **form** it will take... Will it be a book? A chalk drawing? A chair? A song? A sculpture? A comic book?
3. Idiom (风格): The "school" of art, the vocabulary of styles or gestures or subject matter, the **genre** that the work belongs to... Maybe a genre of its own.
4. Structure: Putting it all together... What to include, what to leave out... How to arrange, how to **compose** the work.
5. Craft: Constructing the work, applying skills, practical knowledge, invention, problem-solving, getting the "**job**" done.
6. Surface: Production values, finishing... The aspects most apparent on first superficial exposure to the work.

注: 3 中的 vocabulary 应当指 a supply of expressive techniques or devices (as of an art form)
