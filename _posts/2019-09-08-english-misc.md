## 杂项

2020/10/20

> If you introduce someone to something, you cause them to learn about it or experience it for the first time. 使初次接触

一开始读到愣了一愣, 因为直觉上应该是 introduce sth to sb.

游戏中的脆皮叫 squishy, 而不是 squashy. 这两个词字典意思上并没有什么区别, 但是游戏俚语中就是用前者.

## Unisex refers to both sexes

2020/8/30

聊天时遇到了 unisex, 挺反直觉的.

> The combining form **uni-** does normally mean 'one, having or consisting of one': it comes from Latin *unus* 'one'. It forms words such as **unicycle**, a term for a cycle with just one wheel, and **unicellular**, meaning 'consisting of a single cell'. And in fact the 20-volume historical *Oxford English Dictionary* contains entries for the words **unisexual**, meaning 'of one sex or relating to one sex' and **unisexuality**, meaning 'the state of being unisexual'. Both these words date back to the early 19th century.
> 
> **Unisex** is a much newer word: it was coined in the 1960s and originally used in relatively informal contexts. Its formation seems to have been influenced by words such as **union**, **united**, and **universal**, from which it took the sense of something that was shared. So **unisex** can be understood as referring to one thing (such as a clothing style or hairstyle) that is shared by both sexes.

## 一些聊天常用缩写

2020/7/3

来自我的个人体验.

- iirc: if I remember correctly
- idk: I don't know. 
- imo: in my opinion. 大概比 imho 频繁百倍 (以我有的数据而言).
- tbh: to be honest

## Accord and Accordance

2020/2/10

前几周有一次想写 "一致" 时, 想到 accordance, 查了一下 in accordance 却不是一致的意思, 最后写了 consistent. 后来突然看到了 in accord 才发现这才是一致.

- To be in accord is to be in agreement. 
- To be in accordance is to be in compliance.

See [How to Use Accord vs. accordance Correctly – Grammarist](https://grammarist.com/usage/accord-accordance/).

## more than (is) necessary

## The poor man's somebody/something 

2020/1/10

在几个不同的地方看到过 poor man's xx 的表达. 意思是

> a person or thing that is similar to but of a lower quality than a particular famous person or thing

例句

- Sparkling white wine is the poor man's champagne.
- Pewter is the poor man's silver.
- a young actor who is said to be the poor man's James Dean

TeX 中有个指令是 `\pmb`, poor man's bold: typesetting the same letter multiple times a bit shifted to the left and the right makes it look bold. But it isn't. It is just a hackish way to get ugly bold letters for people not able to afford a real bold font. That's what poor mans bold is (让人不由地想起了抖音的 icon). From [How do you reliably bold math](https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26738).

## Difference and Differences 

2019/12/15

前几周有一次我想写 doesn't make much difference 时迟疑了, 因为我记得很清楚有 make a big difference 这类表达, which implies the word 'difference' should be countable, 那么我应该写为 doesn't make many differences, 但这又严重违背了我的语感. 后来翻字典, 发现可数不可数都有, 而 make xx difference 这类词组的共同点是形式全都是不加 s 的, e.g. make a lot of difference, 应该还是一种表达习惯吧. 其他例句有

- There are no significant differences between the education systems of the two countries.
- There's no difference in the results.

## Shall and Will

2019/9/8

起因是之前我想写 "我将要" 时, 一时疑惑不知道该写 "I shall" 还是 "I will". 查了查发现 Wiki 上甚至专门有 "Shall and will" 这个词条.

对于传统标准英式英语
- future tense: **shall** 第 1 人称, **will** 第 2, 3 人称
- strong determination: **shall** 第 2, 3 人称, **will** 第 1 人称

- I shall be late; she will not be there.
- I will not tolerate this; you shall go to school.

而现代英语这两个词用法的区别几乎不复存在, shall 很少用, 还显得 old-fashioned or formal. 

> The interchangeable use of shall and will is now part of standard British and US English. In modern English the traditional difference between **shall** and **will** has almost disappeared, and **shall** is not used very much at all, especially in North American English. **Shall** is now only used with *I* and *we*, and often sounds formal and old-fashioned.

People are more likely to say: 
- I'll (= I will) be late. 
- You'll (= You will) apologize immediately.

在英式英语中 shall 仍然会用于 "shall we/I"  以提问或提供建议或帮助.
 
- What shall we do this weekend?
- Shall I send you the book?

翻了一下手头的 OALD 第 6 版 (零几年出版的), shall 词条和第 9 版是一样的. 但我记得我中学的时候确实有学过区分 shall 和 will, 不然也不会出现开头的迟疑... (2019/9/9)
