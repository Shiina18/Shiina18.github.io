在相当长的一段时间中, 我们的科普界似乎有一种很流行的观念, 即认为好的科普著作, 就在于以通俗的语言准确地向普通读者讲清科学道理. 当然, 这也是一种类型的科普, 但却绝不是唯一种类的科普, 更不是科普的最高境界. 作为一本优秀的科普著作, 语言的通俗和科学概念的准确只是最起码的必要条件, 甚至于连趣味性都可归入此列, 除了这些基本要求之外, 真正优秀的科普著作应该能向读者传达一种精神, 一种思考的方法, 能带给读者一种独特的视角, 以及一种科学的品味, 一种人文的观念.

The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.

Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.

From Francis Bacon, [The Essays](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/28623-read-not-to-contradict-and-confute-nor-to-believe-and).

糟糕的是, 人们总是把 crush 误以为是爱情, 败坏那份幻想的轻盈. 人们迫不及待地要从那瞬间的亮光中, 拉扯出一大段拖沓的故事, 最后被这拖沓淹没, 深陷泥沼, 积重难返.

然而闪电怎么可能被固定住呢? 某同学说, 面对有些可能性, 转过身去, 是个美丽的错误, 但是迎上前去, 则是一个愚蠢的错误.

所以当 crush 来临的时候, 放任它, 但无需试图抓住它, 把它的头强行按到爱情的粮草当中去. 你可以托着下巴, 设计那些明明不可能发生的事情的每一个细节, 与自己辩论下一次见到他时该穿的衣服, 该说的话, 与此同时, 你深深地知道其实下个月, 你就会将他忘记. 你看着手中的那根火柴, 那么短, 慢慢地烧到了指间, 然后熄灭. 熄灭之后, 你心存感激, 感谢它的光, 也感谢它的稍纵即逝.

A text is what you read in order to learn something. A reference is something you look back on after you know the outlines of a subject in order to get difficult theorems exactly right.

One function of a text (rather than a reference) is to decide what an average reader really needs to know about a subject, and what can be safely left out. So, if you want to know everything about a subject, consult a reference.

黛：先生はあの老人がジムのバーグを持ていたから、次の駅で降りられると思われた. でも、降りない可能性だってあったんです. 次の駅で降りるというのは、あなたの根拠薄弱の推測でしかない. あなたは「席を譲りましょうか」と聞くべきでした. たとえあなたの方が断ったとしても、その手続きこそが重要なんです. 暗黙のルールとされている手順を踏むこと、そのものがマナーなんです. 

From Legal High se. 1 ep. 1.

There is a perverse element in the titles of mathematical texts. The most difficult are usually entitled *Introduction to ...* or *The Elementary Theory of ...* Feller's book is doubly difficult, since it is an "introduction" and it is only volume I.

From David Salsburg's *The Lady Tasting Tea* p. 224.

Some of Kolmogorov's favorite activities were teaching and organizing classes at a school for gifted children in Moscow. He enjoyed introducing the children to literature and music. He took them on hikes and expeditions. He felt that each child should have a "broad and natural development of the whole personality," David Kendall wrote. "It did not worry him if they did not become mathematicians. Whatever profession they ultimately followed, he was content if their outlook remained broad and their curiosity unstifled."

From David Salsburg's *The Lady Tasting Tea* p. 141.

There are different types of mathematical writing. Some "definitive" texts are cold and sparse, presenting a sequence of theorems and proofs with little or no motivation. In some texts, the proofs are turgid and difficult, plowing with determination from hypotheses to conclusion. There are some definitive texts that are filled with elegant proofs, where the course of the mathematics has been boiled down to seemingly simple steps that move effortlessly to the final conclusions. There are also a very small number of definitive texts in which the authors try to provide the background and ideas behind the problems, in which the history of the subject is described, and in which examples are taken from interesting reallife situations.

From David Salsburg's *The Lady Tasting Tea* p. 59.

之后一段是说: These last characteristics describe Gumbel's *Statistics of Extremes*. It is a magnificently lucid presentation of a difficult subject, filled with references to the development of the subject.

魔王：私はこの世界において、教育が最も大きな力を持つようになると思う. 本当の世界の広さは、誰にも分らないほど広いのだ. それなのに、誰もが己の常識や知識に当てはめて知ったつもりになる. しかも、教育がより重要である理由は、教育が重要であるという事実も、教育がないと理解されないという点にある.

A good speech should be like a woman's skirt; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest.

In our ninja training, Master Splinter is constantly telling us that when given two choices, always choose the harder path.

I strongly feel that our history of silence never did us many good — silence only perpetuates more silence, while talking normally gives birth to more talking, more sharing, more identification, more awareness, more change.

The rejection of facts, the rejection of reason and science — that is the path to decline. It calls to mind the words of Carl Sagan, who graduated high school here in New Jersey, he said: “We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.”

...

If you disagree with somebody, bring them in and ask them tough questions. Hold their feet to the fire. Make them defend their positions. If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong. Engage it. Debate it. Stand up for what you believe in. Don't be scared to take somebody on. Don't feel like you got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities. Go at them if they're not making any sense.

Use your logic and reason and words. And by doing so, you'll strengthen your own position, and you'll hone your arguments. And maybe you'll learn something and realize you don't know everything. And you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe. Either way, you win.

生命是宇宙赠予我们的珍宝: 虽然永远超脱不了自然规律, 却能在局域的非平衡系统中创造出秩序, 进而产生美. 生活是追求秩序和终极之美的过程; 因此人们思考科学与哲学, 画画唱歌, 有时还结伴而行, 做各种美好的事情. 虽然成本很高, 个体的生命也终将失败 (死亡: 系统的熵最终不可避免地增长), 我们仍会竭尽全力地让这个体系, 以及人群所组成的依然微不足道的体系所容纳的信息再多一点, 再美一点. 生命本身难免丑陋, 渺小又脆弱, 但又同时具有这种潜能, 如此才使得这个多数时间与空间区域都无所谓目的的世界对生命而言不再显得那么绝望.
